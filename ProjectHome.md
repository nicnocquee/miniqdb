miniqdb is a minimalistic quote database (QDB) written in PHP, utilizing a MySQL database. QDBs are commonly used to archive funny or important older conversations within IRC channels. This code started as a QDB for a (private) channel I'm in, and I decided to open up the code.

Quotes can be viewed in many ways: an individual quote, all quotes in the database, in order, a random 20 or so quotes, and the latest 10 quotes.

We have no plans to implement user authentication; .htaccess works just fine for us. The purpose of miniqdb is to have a lightweight QDB with enough features to make most people happy. For those who wish to have stronger authentication and more features, [Chirpy!](http://chirpy.sourceforge.net/) is a great open source QDB project.
