= miniqdb API =
The miniqdb API is a simple way for non-humans to read the database. It is provided through api.php.

REST (XML) is currently implemented; JSON is soon to come. More actions will also soon be available.

Throughout this documentation, the root of the miniqdb instance will be {{{http://example.com/stuff/miniqdb}}}; therefore, the URL we will be accessing will be {{{http://example.com/stuff/miniqdb/api.php}}}.

== Basic syntax ==
URLs are setup using GET requests. For example, accessing the URL
  {{{http://example.com/stuff/miniqdb/api.php?method=rest&act=quote&id=42}}}
would return quote 42 in REST format.

The _method_ variable is optional; it defaults to rest. The _act_ variable is *required*. Other variables may be available or required depending on the action; per-action syntax is defined below.

== quote ==
Retrieve a single quote by id.

|| *Variable* || *Required?* || *Description* ||
|| id || yes || id of quote you want to access ||

Example: {{{http://example.com/stuff/miniqdb/api.php?method=rest&act=quote&id=42}}} would return quote 42.

== stats ==
Retrieve statistics on the qdb.

|| *Variable* || *Required?* || *Description* ||
|| || || There are no variables for this action ||

Example: {{{http://example.com/stuff/miniqdb/api.php?method=rest&act=stats}}} would return statistics.

== Errors ==
|| *Error number* || *Error text* || *Explanation* ||
