====================

Rename this folder to 'Miniqdb' and move it to your plugins directory.
Then tell your bot to 'load Miniqdb'.

Before you're able to use the plugin for a specific channel, you have to set
the miniqdbRoot configuration option for this plugin. If you use basic
authentication, you need to set auth.username and auth.password. That is all.
